The Final Round was held on the 31st of march 2023 at the Ion Creangă State Pedagogical University in Clasa vITorului, our team  and also the rest of the participants were welcome to plant a tree in Dendrarium Park. It was a experience in which i learnt new things about my rights as a teenager, that my voice counts and i am responsable of big future changes.</p>
